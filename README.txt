* Many jobs today depend on a computer, which is the main working tool for many workers.
Can companies monitor the communications of their workers through the company's computers? 
Even when they are private, non-work conversations?

On September 5, 2017, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights issued a [Judgment] 
(hudoc.echr.coe.int/spa?i=001-177082) in which it establishes the requirements for a company in Europe 
to be able to legally monitor the communications of its workers through the company's computers.

The criteria of the ruling are known as the "Barbulescu Test": you can then answer the questions to check whether 
the communications monitoring of your company's employees is legal.
